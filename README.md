# OpenMP-of-Dwarfs

## Proposal:  
###  Abstract :  
    1, OpenDwarf problems  
    2, OpenMP + OpenACC  
###  Introduction:  
    1, 13 Dwarfs  
    2, OpenMP + OpenACC  
###  Hypothesis:  
    1, OpenMP or OpenACC which one is faster  
    2, same for both benchmarks?  
    3, Are the benchmarks suitable for CPU or GPU  
    4, How to measure paralleliztion?  
    5, How much of the code is serial and how much can we parallel  
    
###  Specific Benchmarks  
    1, Gem:  
      Introduction  
      Analysis complexity  
    2, BFS  
      Introduction  
      Analysis complexity  
    3, Run both under OpenCL --> original implementation  

###  Implementation and Optimization:  
    1,Servers architecture  
    
    
# To do list:  
   1, Run both under OpenCL --> original implementation  
   1, Proposal  
   2,

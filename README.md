# OpenMP-of-Dwarfs

## Proposal:  
###  Abstract :  
    1, OpenDwarf problems  
    2, OpenMP + OpenACC  


###  Introduction:  
    1, 13 Dwarfs  
    2, OpenMP + OpenACC  
    3, What do you propose to do?

###  Why Important:  
    1,

    
###  Specific Benchmarks  
    1, Gem:  
      Introduction  
      Analysis complexity  
    2, BFS  
      Introduction  
      Analysis complexity  
    3, Run both under OpenCL --> original implementation    
    4, Approaches 
    
###  Hypothesis:  
    1, OpenMP or OpenACC which one is faster(Are the benchmarks suitable for CPU or GPU)  
    2, same for both benchmarks?  
    //3, Are the benchmarks suitable for CPU or GPU  
    4, How to measure paralleliztion?  
    5, How much of the code is serial and how much can we parallel  
    
    //Note: 1 and 3 are close to the same thing actually?   Agree
    
###  Implementation and Optimization:  
    1,Servers architecture  
    
    
# To do list:  
   1, Run both under OpenCL --> original implementation  
   1, Proposal
